Elegant single-page editor for curating PubMed abstracts with Quill, PMID helpers, and polished dark/light theming.

## Features

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3. Begin editing directly in the main canvasâ€”changes stay local to your browser.

## Usage Tips

- Highlight text and click the `PMID` button to wrap identifiers in the custom tag.

## Development Notes
